Caesar Cipher Implementation in Python
This project is a Python implementation of the Caesar Cipher, one of the simplest encryption techniques. The Caesar Cipher is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a certain number of positions down or up the alphabet.

Features:
Encrypts and decrypts messages using a shift key.
Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters.
Can be customized with different shift values.
Ignores non-alphabetic characters while maintaining them in the output.

Usage:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Run the script and follow the prompts to encrypt or decrypt a message.
Customize the shift value to suit your needs.

Example:
Input:  "HELLO WORLD"
Shift:  3
Output: "KHOOR ZRUOG"

This repository serves as a basic example of classical cryptography and can be a starting point for further exploration of more complex encryption algorithms.
